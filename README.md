# OpenWorldz

A bunch of code was used from the threejs Documentation. I used code from the Three.js Setup Guide Tutorial | Getting Started with React + Three.js by "Suboptimal Engineer" to change everything to React. Will one day rewrite that foundation code into my own code using the basic building blocks of three.js.


This game was created with React- To run the code do the following:

git clone https://www.github.com/robgleason/OpenWorldz
npm install
npm run dev
